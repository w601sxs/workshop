Team 2 Tasks

@Paulsen, Chelsey @Patel, Harsh @NagendraPrasad, Sujith

- Three major steps were identified:
- Raw csv to common pandas data frame
- Common pandas dataframe to use-case specific data
- Use case-specific data is used to train a specific model
- Explore both paths : ETL for preparing training data using Glue, and lambda based processing for real time invocations
- As discussed, let’s demonstrate this with one use case “did the agent lead with value or price?”
